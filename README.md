# hrrm

### Hrrm... what?

Make time manage itself by automatically generating daily schedules.

### Zzz... PDAs have been doing this since 1860.

Yeah, they have. So what. This is mostly an excuse to play with Go and Pure.css

### What kind of a name is "hrrm"? How do you even pronounce that?

It's derived from the Latin word *horarium* which means "daily schedule". Take away the vowels
and you get "hrrm". It's pronounced "Herm", and is also something of a pun on the sound that
people make when they don't really know what to do next. (Which hrrm attempts to solve.) I know,
I spend far too much time naming things.
